# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version: `ruby-3.2.2`
* System dependencies: `MySql`

* Database creation:
  - Set your data base credentials

* Database initialization: `rails db:create db:migrate`

* How to run the test suite: `rspec spec`


You can use postman to import API collection ('/postman_files') and use it to call server and play the game.
